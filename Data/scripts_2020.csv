"43199","After receiving an email from Taika Waititi in 2010 about the possibility of a film option on my","Jojo Rabbit"
"43200","novel Caging Skies, the first thing I did was watch his short films, “Tama Tu” and “Two Cars, One","Jojo Rabbit"
"43201","Night.” Afterwards, I went to the cinemas to watch Boy. His fine balancing act between drama","Jojo Rabbit"
"43202","and humour convinced me that we were coming from the same place artistically. I can still","Jojo Rabbit"
"43203","see him putting his arms behind his head and his feet up on the desk as he observed the sea","Jojo Rabbit"

"43208","That day, he explained to me how he saw the film and what parts of the book he would focus on.","Jojo Rabbit"
"43209","My main concern was that I’d seen film adaptations so faithful to the book that they somehow","Jojo Rabbit"
"43210","ended up unfaithful in essence, despite the well-meaning intentions. The challenge is that a book","Jojo Rabbit"
"43211","doesn’t go directly from the book to the screen; it goes page to page. Taika’s script had much to","Jojo Rabbit"
"43212","take from the book, yet it also had to escape it in order to come fully to life in its own medium. A","Jojo Rabbit"
"43213","reader spends a comparatively long time in there on his or her own, days or even weeks, in the","Jojo Rabbit"
"43214","dense chrysalis of prose, experiencing the emotions of the story while oblivious to the world.","Jojo Rabbit"
"43215","","Jojo Rabbit"
"43216","","Jojo Rabbit"
"43217","The script had to break out of all this and be able to fly with its own wings. It had to be lighter than","Jojo Rabbit"
"43218","the book. Yet, it still had to handle the condensed weight of the plot, the historical premises, the","Jojo Rabbit"
"43219","hopes, dreams and pains of the main characters, while being able to navigate all the tonal shifts.","Jojo Rabbit"
"43220","This metaphor of the butterfly finds literal examples in Taika’s script/film: the butterflies that","Jojo Rabbit"
"43221","flutter in Johannes’ stomach as he thinks of Elsa, and another butterfly that will lead to one of","Jojo Rabbit"
"43222","the most poignant moments in the film.","Jojo Rabbit"

"43225","Reading the script, I felt that Taika had stayed true to the story, both by what he took and what","Jojo Rabbit"
"43226","he so generously gave of himself to it: his heart, humour, inimitable spirit. That’s all that I could","Jojo Rabbit"
"43227","have hoped for as the author of the book. Where Caging Skies exists as a classical painting,","Jojo Rabbit"
"43228","Taika’s film is more like Picasso’s Guernica – the essential scenes are all there, but he adds his","Jojo Rabbit"
"43229","own personal touches. Taika made the bold move to make Hitler an imaginary “friend,” and","Jojo Rabbit"
"43230","though comical, in Taika’s films, the laughs are never free. Based on the countless images of","Jojo Rabbit"
"43231","Hitler courting children’s admiration as part of the process of indoctrination, it was a risk that","Jojo Rabbit"
